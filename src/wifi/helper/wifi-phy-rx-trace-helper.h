/**
 * @class WifiPhyRxTraceHelper
 * @brief Assists in tracing and analyzing Wi-Fi Physical Layer (PHY) receptions.
 *
 * The WifiPhyRxTraceHelper class can be used to instrument Wi-Fi nodes (or devices, or
 * links) to keep track of the reception of Wi-Fi signals, and in particular, whether they overlap
 * (collide) with one another.  The implementation maintains reception records within internal
 * data structures, and statistics or full reception records can be queried.
 *
 * The class provides functionality to connect traces to all nodes and WifiNetDevices within scope,
 * enabling the capture of all Physical Protocol Data Units (PPDUs) received. It also
 * allows for the collection and retrieval of statistics related to successful and failed receptions
 * of PPDUs containing unicast data, and their corresponding MAC Protocol Data Units (MPDUs).
 *
 * Key features include:
 * - Enabling trace connections to capture reception data.
 * - Starting and stopping the collection of statistics at specified times.
 * - Resetting the collected data for fresh starts in data collection.
 * - Accessing detailed reception records for further analysis.
 *
 * Usage involves connecting to desired nodes or devices, (optionally) managing the
 * collection period with start, stop, and reset methods, and finally, accessing the collected
 * statistics or reception records.
 *
 * Statistics are only compiled for unicast data (WIFI_MAC_DATA and WIFI_MAC_QOSDATA), although
 * PPDU records are kept for all frame types because it is possible for non-data frames to
 * collide with data frames.
